AI Reliability SDK

> AI Reliability SDK for AI developers to understand AI workflows. 
> It doesn't just show what happened. 
>It helps you understand why.

## Problem

Most AI applications focus only on generating outputs.

They ignore everything else:

- What happened when a call failed?
- How many retries occurred?
- Which step broke the workflow?
- What decision was made and why?
- How do you debug it later?

Without answers to these questions, AI systems become black boxes.
Failures are invisible. Debugging is guesswork.

---

## Solution

AI Activity Logger wraps your AI workflow with a structured
observability layer.

Every execution is tracked, every failure is recorded,
every retry is logged, every decision has an explanation.

**The system captures:**
- Inputs and outputs
- Step-by-step execution trace
- Retry attempts and outcomes
- AI-generated decision explanations
- Error categorization and recovery actions

## Current Features

### Input Validation
- Type checking and range validation
- Structured error responses

### API Integration Layer
- External API calls with timeout handling
- Response parsing and data extraction

### Reliability Engine
- Automatic retry on temporary failures
- Permanent failure detection and termination
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Per-attempt trace logging

### AI Explanation Layer
- AI-generated plain-English explanations for each workflow outcome
- Structured JSON output parsing
- Explanation storage alongside execution data

### Workflow Tracing
- Multi-step execution tracking
- Step ordering and status per step
- Attempt counts per workflow stage

### Persistent Storage
- SQLite-based log storage
- Full execution history
- Queryable by request ID

### REST API Access
- FastAPI endpoints for log retrieval
- Query logs by ID
- JSON responses
